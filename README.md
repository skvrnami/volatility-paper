To replicate the results, run the scripts in the following order:

- `prepare_data.R` - prepare data
- `charts.R` - make charts
- `models.R` - estimate models
- `wcn.R` - calculate average WCN (weighted candidate novelty) for genuinely and partially new parties

The dataset containing the list of new parties is stored in `data/new_parties_final.xlsx`.
